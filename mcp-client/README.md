This is my custom Langgraph mcp client.

I also have custom MCP server.


The idea of this project is to closely monitory my day-to-day activities, learnings, the information I consume and give me feedback on my consumption, create action items if any from the mail.

The mcp server will have tools that can access my gmail, youtube history, maybe chrome browser history and all
