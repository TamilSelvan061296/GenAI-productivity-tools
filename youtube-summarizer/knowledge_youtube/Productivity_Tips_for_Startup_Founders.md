# Productivity Tips for Startup Founders

Here are the key productivity tips from the video, organized individually for easy reference:

---

## Tip 1: Focus Relentlessly on Your Customer
- The foundation of productivity is knowing what your customers care about and staying laser-focused on solving their problems.
- Avoid distractions and shiny objects; prioritize work that directly benefits customers and moves your business forward.

---

## Tip 2: Explicitly Set and Review Priorities
- Write down your goals, identify bottlenecks, and align your activities with your main KPI (e.g., revenue growth).
- Regularly audit your calendar to ensure you’re spending time on high-priority tasks.

---

## Tip 3: Customize Your Productivity Tools
- It's okay to use simple tools (like Apple Notes or spreadsheets) instead of complex productivity systems that don't fit your workflow.
- Avoid building elaborate organizational structures before finding product-market fit; focus on staying close to your customer.

---

## Tip 4: Beware of "Productivity Porn" & Fake Work
- Avoid getting stuck reading extreme productivity advice or engaging in work that feels productive but doesn’t drive the business forward.
- Fake work feels like work but makes no real progress—always link your actions back to core goals.

---

## Tip 5: Maker Schedule vs. Manager Schedule
- Understand the difference: makers (e.g., programmers) need large blocks of uninterrupted time, while managers benefit from back-to-back meetings.
- Don’t mix the two—block your calendar intentionally to support deep work as needed.

---

## Tip 6: Manage Social Media Use
- Social media can be distracting and cultivate a misleading self-image for founders.
- Only engage on platforms where your customers are; otherwise, avoid unnecessary validation and focus on customer impact.

---

## Tip 7: Stack Rank & Ruthlessly Prioritize Tasks
- List out all projects or tasks, rank them by importance, and only work on the top priorities.
- Saying "no" to lower-priority tasks is crucial; don't spread yourself too thin.
- Steve Jobs famously said: "Focus is saying no."

---

## Tip 8: Self-Awareness and Delegation
- Know your strengths and ensure you spend time on tasks only you can uniquely accomplish.
- Delegate or empower others for things you're not best at.

---

## Tip 9: Avoid Multitasking—Hyperfocus Instead
- Multitasking is a myth; the most productive founders hyperfocus on core work.
- Don’t constantly search for shortcuts or mindless productivity tools; putting in the hours on what matters is irreplaceable.

---

**Summary:**
Productivity for startup founders means prioritizing what truly matters, minimizing distractions, intentionally managing your calendar and tasks, leveraging your strengths, and being willing to say "no". The best founders aren’t obsessed with elaborate productivity systems—they focus on customer impact, deep work, and clear priorities.
