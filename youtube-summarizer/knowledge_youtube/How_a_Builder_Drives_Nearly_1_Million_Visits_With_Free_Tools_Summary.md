## Introduction: The Challenge Builders Face

The video opens with Pat Walls addressing a repeating concern in the Starter Story community: while building products is exciting, most indie hackers struggle with marketing. Banu is introduced as someone who cracked this code, growing his SaaS to impressive numbers—$13,000 MRR and 50,000 monthly visitors—without spending a cent on promotional campaigns. His transparent analytics and clear, builder-friendly approach set the stage for a deep dive into his tactics.

## Banu’s Journey to SaaS Success

Banu recounts his background: starting as a software engineer, quitting his job after eight months, and returning home to focus on building his own projects. His first SaaS, Feather, grew steadily, but the recent explosion of AI tools inspired him to build Site GPT—a chatbot solution for websites. After two weeks, Site GPT was launched and quickly hit $10,000 MRR in the first month. Realizing its potential, he sold his previous project to focus fully on Site GPT, which uses a straightforward monthly subscription model.

Context is provided for the product: Site GPT acts as an AI assistant for business websites, operating 24/7 to answer questions. Banu notes the business’s high customer lifetime value (around $1,700–$1,800 per customer) and conversion rate, sharing concrete signup and conversion numbers to validate his progress.

## The Free Tools Strategy: Engineering as Marketing

Pat prompts Banu to discuss the basis of his growth: building free, simple tools that attract organic traffic from Google. Banu explains that nearly 90% of his Google traffic comes from these free tools (PDF-to-Markdown converters, chatbot name generators, etc.), which are easy to make, quick to launch, and targeted at potential users of his main product. 

He describes his process for generating these tools: leveraging AI to build new ones in minutes based on keyword research and user needs, enabling consistent growth in clicks, leads, and customer trials.

## Step-by-Step Playbook: How You Can Do It Too

Banu lays out a detailed, 7-step playbook:

1. **Keyword Discovery:** Using Ahrefs Keyword Explorer, leave the input blank and search broadly. Apply filters to target keywords relevant to your product, like “AI generator.”
2. **Difficulty and Volume Filtering:** Add keyword difficulty (max 10) and search volume (at least 1,000 monthly) filters to find low-competition, high-volume keywords.
3. **Relevance Sorting:** Build a list of keywords, checking each for relevance to your SaaS.
4. **Prioritization:** Create a Notion table to rank keywords by difficulty, volume, relevance, and development ease.
5. **Tool Ideation:** For every keyword, plan a free tool that would appeal to users searching for that term.
6. **Effective CTA:** For each tool, craft a clear call-to-action that gently pushes users towards your main SaaS.
7. **Rapid Development:** Use templates and existing tools to build new ones quickly, prioritizing high-volume, low-difficulty ideas that link naturally to your core product.

Pat emphasizes how Banu’s approach leverages the fun of building—allowing makers to market through creation, not cold outreach, sales, or writing content.

## Lessons and Advice for Builders

Reflecting on his journey, Banu shares his biggest advice: "Don’t spend months launching. Ship a core feature fast and let user feedback guide your direction." He urges makers to iterate quickly, using real user input to shape development, rather than chasing perfection before release.

Pat and Banu wrap up by reiterating that engineers and indie hackers don’t have to be ‘marketers.’ The free tool strategy channels creative energy into product-centric marketing—a natural fit for those who prefer building to pitching.
