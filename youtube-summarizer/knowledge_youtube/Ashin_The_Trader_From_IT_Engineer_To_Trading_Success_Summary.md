# Ashin: From IT Professional to Self-Made Trader – A Journey Through Highs, Lows, and Finding Process

Trading is often seen as a thrilling, lucrative alternative to conventionally stable careers, especially by those from technical backgrounds. This video chronicles the remarkable transformation of Ashin, an IT professional who navigated the exhilarating ups and precarious downs of trading to ultimately build a sustainable, process-driven approach. Through candid storytelling with host Vivek, Ashin discusses his journey, the psychological battleground of trading, and the critical lessons that shifted his fate from repeated account blow-ups to consistent market success.

## Early Career and the Seeds of Change
Ashin begins by sharing his academic roots in Computer Science and Physics. His journey started at Flipkart as an intern, before moving to PhonePe when it was a budding startup. Six intense years in the world of tech startups left him burnt out, leading him to take a break and eventually explore trading—a venture that started with curiosity and the confidence of significant savings. Initially, trading felt like an adventurous gamble; the excitement quickly propelled his trading capital from 60 lakhs to nearly 1 crore in a few months.

## Rapid Ascent and the Hard Reality of Losses
The euphoria from early winnings didn’t last. Becoming lax after initial success, Ashin found himself losing almost all profits in just a month. He narrates how capital depletion continued over the next year until his account was down to a fraction—around 17 lakhs. These tough moments were compounded by the disappearance of optimism and mounting stress, but coincidentally, the liquidation of his PhonePe stock options offered him a second financial lifeline to re-enter the market, albeit with renewed anxiety and the weight of past mistakes.

## Psychological Turning Points: Facing the Screen
Trading large sums on leverage during major events (like the Indian election result day) led to devastating losses once again. Twice, he saw his account collapse from life-changing highs, leaving him with the sobering realization: “It’s not the strategy, but my psychology that’s the problem.”

He learned to process pain instead of ignoring it. Instead of blaming circumstance, he examined his emotional responses to loss, aiming to transform his weakness into a strength. This phase became about systematizing his process—“process over emotions”—and using routines, emotional check-ins, and logical record keeping to minimize the sway of impulsive action.

## Systematizing Success: Metrics, Routines, and Market Breadth
Ashin’s approach evolved: he began meticulously tracking market breadth indicators, reviewing thousands of charts to build mental muscle memory, and objectively analyzing portfolio upswings and drawdowns. During a key market downturn (aided by world events and technical setups), Ashin committed big to short positions, achieving a dramatic account recovery, but not without accepting the real possibility of failure and having planned to return to a corporate job if things didn’t work out.

## The Role of Process, Peer Review, and Technical Simplicity
Ashin’s process now emphasizes peer accountability, technical simplicity, and emotional rules:
- Every trade is documented with screenshots and shared with trading peers—explaining the setup and rationale out loud. This forced clarity exposes weak convictions and raises his bar for entry.
- Main tools: Price, volume, and moving averages. Simplicity keeps him anchored.
- Most entries and augmentations are based on larger timeframes—weekly or daily for strong context—and only add to positions that are already profitable.
- He shares a caution about leverage: “Don’t jump into leverage instruments like futures or commodities without first being consistently profitable in cash setups.”

## Evolving Setups: The Power of the Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP)
A significant technical learning for Ashin is the Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP): monitoring how strong uptrends tighten and consolidate, forming bases. Understanding the behavioral narrative behind these patterns—how market players exit, re-enter, and ultimately push price through resistance—gives Ashin the conviction to size up trades and ride trends. Logging charts (logarithmic scale) and focusing on a few robust setups remove emotional FOMO and make filtering opportunities easier.

## Regret, Reflection, and Mental Models
Ashin admits to missing some multi-decade opportunities, like a sizeable move in silver, and shares how learning from regret is core to ongoing improvement. He places huge value on mental models—ways to understand market mechanics not as numbers, but as people with emotions, intentions, and reactions. Viewing oneself as “the hero in your own story,” he emphasizes, reframes setbacks as part of the process.

## Key Takeaways
- **Rapid success can breed complacency**. Losses are more instructive than wins—face them, process the associated emotions, and analyze your response.
- **Trading is a psychological game** as much as a technical one. Self-awareness, emotional control, and the right routines turn suffering into progress.
- **Systematize everything:** track metrics, reflect daily, use peer reviews, and document setups. Move process to the fore and emotions to the background.
- **Master your strategy before sizing up**. Deep specialization, such as VCP, and focus on bread-and-butter setups enable consistency. Avoid excessive FOMO.
- **Only add to winning trades**. Use longer timeframes for context and allow profitable trades to develop; avoid averaging into losing positions.
- **Simplicity is power:** Few indicators, clear checklists, minimal distractions foster “conviction through clarity”.
- **Mental models matter:** Market is not just numbers but narratives. Think like a protagonist; create hero arcs out of adversity.

Ashin’s story is one of reflection, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of process. It illustrates that trading mastery can come, not from access to exotic tools or information, but by internalizing lessons, leaning into discomfort, and methodically building systems around human weakness. His journey—shared with vulnerability—serves as a blueprint for traders striving to move beyond luck to sustainable edge.
